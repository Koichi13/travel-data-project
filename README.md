# Proposal
Project Title  
  >Domestic Flight Delay Correlations  
  
Team Members  
  >Josh Barclay  
  >Prabhdeep Kadur  
  >Cameron Daniel  
  >Bhavan Bagri  
  
Project Description/Outline  
  >We will be working to find and display any correlations between flight delays and season, airline, airport, weather, distance, and date.  
  
Research Questions to Answer  
  >Does the season/month affect how often a flight is delayed or cancelled?  
  >Does the weather affect how often a flight is delayed or cancelled?  
  >Does the day of the week affect how often a flight is delayed or cancelled?  
  >Does the distance of the flight affect how often a flight is delayed or cancelled?  
  >Which airline has the most delays/cancellations?  
  >Which airport has the most delays/cancellations?  
  >What is the most common reason for a delay/cancellation?  
  >How often is a flight cancelled as opposed to delayed?  
  >Overall: What is the best way to avoid flight delays and cancellations?

Flight data folder contains the CSVs with relevant datasets.

  flights.csv contains all the data and is the main dataset.

  airlines.csv and airports.csv contain information on each airline/airport based on code.
